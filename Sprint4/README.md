## Sprint 4 Summary
For Sprint 4 we were unable to connect the leshan server back end to the front end of our ec2 instance. However we were able to build a completely working front end for project along with a prototype for sensor connection. Looking at the log page you can see exactly the buttons toggle state as well as the time they were toggled at.

To log in use the username: "test" and the password: "pass"

Our other goal for Sprint 4 was close most of if not all the issues from Sprint 3, which we managed to close all the issues but connecting the leshan server to the ec2 instance. We completely finished our front end but the leshan server was unable to be connected due to time constraints.

Lastly, looking at the log page you can see a history of user actions and the time they occured. If you were to interact with any of the buttons or temperature settings on the application, you would find that it would be reflected in the logpage. This logpage would be a good framework for any future updates or features to the project (specifically sensors or a leshan server).
