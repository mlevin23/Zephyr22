## Sprint 4 Summary
For Sprint 4 we were unable to connect the leshan server back end to the front end of our ec2 instance. However we were able to build a completely working front end for project along with a prototype for sensor connection. Looking at the log page you can see exactly the buttons toggle state as well as the time they were toggled at.
