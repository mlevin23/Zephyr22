### Instructions:

To see both parts of our project the following is required.
#### Part 1:
 1. First go to: https://github.com/TNice/Lashaen-Server-Software-Engineering and complete the setting up of net tools with qemu.
 2. Clone our repository with "git clone https://github.com/mlevin23/Zephyr22.git"
 3. Navigate to the sprint 3 folder and launch the leshan server with "java -jar leshan-server-demo.jar"
 4. Once this is done navigate to localhost:8080 and you will be able to see a json object of the names of the clients that are connected to the leshan server.
 
#### Part 2:
To visit the front end of our server, visit the following link:
http://ec2-3-17-62-112.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ 

To log in the username is: "test" and the password is: "pass"

While we were not able to make any progress on connecting the backend to the front end, the front end has been fully completed with a working server log page. For more information look into the README.md.
