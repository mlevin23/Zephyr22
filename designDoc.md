## Deployment environment
- The program will be run in qemu, which will require either a mac or a linux pc. The code will be built in the "zephyr" folder of the zephyrproject directory, and can be built and run using west. The zephyr project requires a c toolchain (we used GNU ARRM Embedded), and will require qemu. Additionally the development environment for zephyr will have to be set up on the machine.
- west build -b qemu_x86 "project" // This will be the command to build the directory, with "project" being the name of the project that we create.
- west build -t run // This will actually run the project once it is built with the above command.
- How will data be saved?
