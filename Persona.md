### Persona:
Our Zephyr system aims to allow homeowners to interact with their living space in a creative, and much more convient way than ever before. 

One of our systems allows for homeowners to change the temperature of their homes with a new user interface, as well as allowing them to adjust how their thermostat works on a schedule to help cut down energy use while they might be away at work for the day. This will involve having the user interact with an interface and selecting a "morning", "afternoon" or "evening" setting and then selecting what they want the default temperature in their home to be during those hours. 

Another one of our systems allows for homeowners with a small infant to have an automatic crib rocker which is enabled by the crying of their child. The aim of this technology is to hopefully allow parents to sleep more throughout the night while their child is young by attempting to rock the child to sleep when they start crying in the middle of the night. Not only can this be used at night, but this tool can also be used during the day. This technology involves a user to select an automatic or manual option, where the automatic option is enabled when the child is crying and disabled when the child is not, and the manual option is an on/off button that the parent can press at their will whenever they would like the crib to start/stop rocking. 

#### Example:
Martha and Jim are new parents of a 2 month old infant named Carry. Martha is on maternity leave while Jim still works a full time job as an accountant--he works from 9-5 everyday. Carry likes to wake up every two hours every single night. This prevents both Martha and Jim from getting a full, well-rested night of sleep since they constantly need to get up to rock Carry. With the stress of taking care of Carry while still trying to make it to work on time and also take care of his wife, Jim wanted a solution that would alleviate some of the stress of having to get up every 2 hours every night. With the automatic crib, Jim and Martha have found that the crib rocking will soothe carry more often than not, and Jim and Martha are able to get more sleep. Not only is this helping Jim and Martha at night, the crib is also allowing Martha to be more productive during the day by rocking Carry back to sleep so that Martha can take care of any chores around the house, or prepare lunch for herself and Carry. 

Another one of our systems is automatic applicances controlled by a timer. This allows for homeowners to get a jumpstart on their daily routines and allows them to have breakfast made more quickly, leave quicker for work, come home and be able to have dinner ready in a more efficient manner, as well as many other uses. This system involves a homeowner picking from a preset list of appliances which are hooked up to a remote access turn-on and then pre-setting which appliances, such as a coffemaker, oven, or bottle-warmer, to turn on at a certain time of day. 

Our last system is automatic light sensors which turn off when homeowners leave the room and turn on when they enter the room. This allows for homeowner to wake up to their lights being slowly dimmed on or come home at night time to an already lit home. This will involve the user to interact with an interactive map of their home and picking which rooms they would like to have the lights turned on in, or turned off in, and at what times. Not only does this allow the homeowner a safe, well-lit home at ease, but it will also cut down on their electric bill by automatically turning off lights in rooms that are not in use.
