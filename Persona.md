### Persona:
Our Zephyr system aims to allow homeowners to interact with their living space in a creative, and much more convient way than ever before. One of our systems allows for homeowners to change the temperature of their homes with a new user interface, as well as allowing them to adjust how their thermostat works on a schedule to help cut down energy use while they might be away at work for the day. This will involve having the user interact with an interface and selecting a "morning", "afternoon" or "evening" setting and then selecting what they want the default temperature in their home to be during those hours.
