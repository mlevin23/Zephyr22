### Final Target:

#### Welcome Page

Our front end will consist of a login page with all the user profiles already preloaded. Once the user logs in they will be directed to a home page which features a welcome message and a toolbar with all available user interface functions, such as modifying house temperatures, appliances and lighting.

#### Temperature Page

If the user navigates to the temperature page, they will be able to adjust the current temperature in specific rooms in the home, as well as edit "Time of Day" temperatures that the house will default to based on the time of day. All of these will be adjustable by a clickable/tapable incrementer on the screen with the current temperature displayed between the "up" and "down" incrementor. The "Time of Day" adjusters work in a similar fashion.

#### Lighting Page

Our lighting page will consist of three buttons: Upstairs, Ground Level, and Basement. When each button is pressed, a floor layout of the selected floor will appear. In order to turn lights on/off in a specific room, a user will press the desired room. Rooms with glowing lightbulbs signal that the room has the lights turned on. Rooms without glowing lightbulbs signal that the room has the lights switched off. 

#### Appliances Page
